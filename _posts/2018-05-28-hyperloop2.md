The Hyperloop High Speed Transportation System


Train is one of the important transport in the whole world. Day by day train transportation becoming more comfortable according to time requirement, which is basically depends upon the speed. In a Normal vehicle the transportation system is moving in free atmosphere, so there is obstacle of air flowing in the atmosphere to the transport systems ,as a  result the speed of the vehicle get decreased. But in Hyperloop transport free air is not the obstacle because the train is moving in a tube. It is being developed as an open source project. Hyperloop is the concept for very high-speed, fixed guide way surface transportation. Hyperloop consist of a low pressure tube with capsule that are transported at both low and high speeds throughout the length of the tube.  High speed Hyperloop train accelerates to 100 mph in 4 seconds in first test.
