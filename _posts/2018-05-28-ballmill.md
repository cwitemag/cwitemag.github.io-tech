Multi-Cylinder Ball Milling Machine


Electrode material has to be crushed into smaller particles and that can be mostly done by ball milling machines. This grinding is done by conventional ball milling machine, jet ball milling machine, planetary ball milling machine and various other machines. But, these machines are expensive and they consume lot of power. Also swelling of electrode material also takes place in conventional ball milling machine. A ball milling machine named Forward Reverse motion, Multi-cylinder ball milling machine has been proposed.

In this ball milling machine there are four cylinder so that more than one samples can 
be milled at a time and a new type of motion has been achieved. This motion is forward reverse motion that gives better results in comparison to conventional ball milling machine and that also in cheap cost.
