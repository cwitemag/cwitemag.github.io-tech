Geothermal Energy

The search and utilization of geothermal energy commenced in Italy in nearly 1900s. Today, Italy produce sufficient power from geothermal energy to operate its entire network of electrical railroads. Geothermal power plants use hydrothermal resources which have two common ingredients water (hydro) and heat (thermal). Geothermal plants require high temperature (300 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit) hydrothermal resources that may come from either dry steam wells or hot water wells. We can use these resources by drilling wells into the earth and piping the steam or hot water to the surface. Geothermal wells are one to two miles deep. Geothermal energy is a renewable resource.   One of its biggest advantages is that it is constantly available.  The constant flow of heat from the Earth ensures an inexhaustible and essentially limitless supply of energy for billions of years to come.
